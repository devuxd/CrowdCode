			In CrowdCode, functions may contain code, <strong>pseudocode</strong>, and other <strong>function stubs</strong>. 
			In Edit a Function, your goal is not necessarily to finish a complete implementation of a function. Rather, you may decide to <strong>sketch</strong> some of the behavior using psuedocode and describe some operation thatâ€™s best done in another function using a <strong>function stub</strong>.

			<strong>Pseudocode</strong> (sections of a line beginning with //#) allows you to sketch algorithms or partial solutions, enabling the crowd to determine how best the algorithm or solution should be accomplished.

			In CrowdCode, you edit code with a local view of the codebase, seeing only the current function on which you are working.  When you call another function, you have to add a sketch of the called function header with an empty body at the bottom of the code editor window (eventually providing an one-line description of what the function is supposed to do). 
		</p>
		<p style="width:550px">
			When implementing a function, you may discover that a function description needs revision, that an additional parameter is required, or even that the function itself is poorly named. In this case, you may edit the header of the function; the crowd will then update any callers of the function to match its new specification.<br />
			<b>Note: </b> 
			you are not allowed to change the description of the API functions (the functions requested by the client).

			<strong>Remember</strong>: Using <strong>psuedocode</strong> and <strong>function stubs</strong> provides an opportunity for the crowd to contribute. For a function with large and complex behavior, sketching some of the behavior provides opportunities for the crowd to consider how it best be done. Rather than build a single monolithic function, function stubs provides an opportunity for code to be decomposed into cohesive functions that can be reused. And - most importantly - function stubs provides an opportunity for many to work on each requested function in parallel.

			In editing the function, you may discover that the function is impossible or inadvisable to implement (i.e. a function that need to use global variables). If you feel this to be the case, you should report the issue:

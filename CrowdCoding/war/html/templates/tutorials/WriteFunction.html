			In CrowdCode, functions may contain code, <strong>pseudocode</strong>, and other <strong>function calls</strong>. 
			In Edit a Function, your goal is not necessarily to finish a complete implementation of a function. Rather, you may decide to <strong>sketch</strong> some of the behavior using psuedocode and describe some operation thatâ€™s best done in another function using a <strong>function call</strong>.

			<strong>Pseudocode</strong> (sections of a line beginning with //#) allows you to sketch algorithms or partial solutions, enabling the crowd to determine how best the algorithm or solution should be accomplished.

			In CrowdCode, you edit code with a local view of the codebase, seeing only the current function on which you are working.  When you call another function, you have to add a sketch of the called function header with an empty body at the bottom of the code editor window (eventually providing an one-line description of what the function is supposed to do). 
		</p>
		<p style="width:550px">
			When implementing a function, you may discover that a function description needs revision, that an additional parameter is required, or even that the function itself is poorly named. In this case, you may edit the header of the function; the crowd will then update any callers of the function to match its new specification.

			<strong>Remember</strong>: Using psuedocode and function calls provides an opportunity for the crowd to contribute. For a function with large and complex behavior, sketching some of the behavior provides opportunities for the crowd to consider how it best be done. Rather than build a single monolithic function, function calls provides an opportunity for code to be decomposed into cohesive functions that can be reused. And - most importantly - function calls provides an opportunity for many to work on each requested function in parallel.

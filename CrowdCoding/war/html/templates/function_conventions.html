<div>
	<p> <strong>Want to sketch something?</strong>
		Write a line of <strong>pseudocode</strong> with
		<span class="pseudoCode">'//#'</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Want to call a function?</strong>
		Add its header with a line of description after the body of the current function and call it without worring about its implementation (you can't implement it here).<br />
		The crowd will look for a matching function or eventually create it if doesn't exist yet.
	</p>
	
	<b>Example:</b>
	<ace-read-string ng-model="pseudocall"></ace-read-string>

	<br />
	<p>
		Note that all function calls are pass by value (i.e., if you pass an
		object to a function, and the function changes the object, you will not
		see the changes).
	</p>

	<!--<p>
		<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
		If you think the function may require more than a few minutes to write, 
		please use pseudocode and psuedocalls to break up the function into smaller 
		pieces that others can work on. If you've gotten two or more reminders to submit, YOU SHOULD SUBMIT NOW!

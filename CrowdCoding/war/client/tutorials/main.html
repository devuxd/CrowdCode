				The <strong>questions tab</strong> lets you search for answers and see questions related to the function that you’re currently working on (or testing). If you find a Question that looks relevant, clicking on it opens its discussion. 
			</p>
			<p>
				You can even edit which questions are related to the current function by toggling the <strong>function name button</strong> to mark the question as related or unrelated (e.g., clicking on “doSpreadsheetCommand” in the example above).
			</p>
			<p>If you can't find what you’re looking for, you can <strong>ask a question</strong>.</p>

				Questions let you get answers from the crowd. You might have a question about the Debug microtask, the meaning of a field in a data structure, or a design decision. Questions can help in any of these cases. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To ask a question, you just need to provide a title and description. Additionally, you can add <strong>tags</strong> to group the question with other related questions (e.g., debugging, error handing). If the question is about the behavior or implementation of a function you’re working on (or testing), you can mark it as <strong>related</strong> to the function.

				When a worker asks a question, everyone in the system gets notified. You now have the opportunity to participate in the discussion. CrowdCode provides several ways to participate. If you have an answer, you can add a new answer. If you see answers that others have provided, you can Comment on the answer. And if you see Questions, Answers, and Comments with which you agree (or disagree), you can <strong>up vote</strong> or <strong>down vote</strong> the item.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you think that discussion on a Question has been concluded, you can mark a Question as <strong>answered</strong>. This lets the crowd know that the question has been answered, and that no further answers are required. In the list of questions, Open questions are indicated with a yellow background while closed questions are indicated with a gray background.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you see a closed question that needs more discussion, you can reopen it

			According to Wikipedia, a test case is a <i>“set of conditions under which a tester will determine whether an application, software system or one of its features is working as it was originally established for it to do”</i>. A test case is not a fully formed and specified test. Rather, a test case specifies - in natural language - a scenario in which a function is to be tested.

		<p style="width:500px"> What are some scenarios that might be valuable to test?
			<ol>
				<li>a number added to zero should return the number itself</li>
				<li>a number added to its opposite should return zero</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p style="width:500px"><b>Note</b>: these test cases do not specify particular values for which the function should be tested. Rather, the test cases abstractly specifies an important scenario in which the function should be tested. How many test cases a function requires ultimately depends on the complexity of a function itself. A function with straightforward behavior might have very few; a function with complex and multifaceted behavior might require several. </p>

		<p style="width:500px"><b>Remember</b>: Good test cases are short, self-explained, and non-redundant!

			In writing test cases, you may discover an issue in the description of the function. If you feel this to be the case, you should report the issue:

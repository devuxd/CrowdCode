            You should be aware only one behavior is implemented by other programmer, while you assess the implementation just consider the behavior that the code implemented.
            In the function description(in the comments above the function) there is a lot of behaviors are written, but one of them is implemented. for example: in the below screenshot function has
            behaviors like 1) it update status of a todo 2) it return false if it can not find the todo. 3)it should call 3rd party api for interacting with database
            4) it throw an exception if arguments be invalid
            <strong style="color: red">But, you should evaluate just one of these behaviors which is implemented, NOT ALL BEHAVIORS</strong>

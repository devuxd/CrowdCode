        <p>Sometimes, behaviors are complicated and you want to create a new function which is responsible for that
            behavior. </p>
        <p>
            If you need a supporting function to realize the implementation, you can create a new function and
            submit your task. This function will then be assigned to OTHER programmers to implement,
            <strong style="color: red">you should NOT implement the new function, you should just write a description in
                the below of main function and call the new function in the body
                of your main function and finally submit it.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Step 1: To create a new function, use shortcut keys OPTION + SPACE(Mac) or CTRL + SPACE(Windows/Linux) and
            select “Add a new function”.

        <p> Step 2: You should ONLY write a comment specifying the function name, description, parameters, parameter
            types and
            return type. The body of the new function will be implemented by other programmers. <strong
                    style="color: red">
                When you want to run your tests, since this new function is not implemented yet,
                You can use the stub feature to replace the actual value (undefined, as the function does not yet exist)
                with
                the intended output that the implementation will eventually produce. </strong>
            The final output will be something like this.

            Step 1: In "inspect mode", clicking on inspect code <img src="/img/tutorial/running/inspect_button.png"
                                                                     width="300px"/></p>
        <p> Step 2: Clicking on a function call opens a popup that allows to stub a function.
        </p>

        <p>
            Step 3: In the stub editor, you can replace the actual output with a stub value representing a desired
            output(click on “stub this function call”).
            This will then automatically replace all calls to this function with this input with the output you
            specified.
            Whenever you run the tests, whatever stubs have been created will be used in place of calling actual
            functions. Run the tests again with the stub for the invoked function.
